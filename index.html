        <h1>Cultivating Change Makers</h1>
        <p>
            African Leadership University is higher education for a higher purpose.
            We believe that young people hold the potential to become the ethical,
            entrepreneurial leaders our continent and planet need. Our role is to
            unlock that potential through a one-of-a-kind learning experience that
            gives students the foundation for a lifetime of leading positive change.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have designed our entire institution around young people’s agency and
            autonomy as changemakers. Students declare missions, not majors –
            defining their educational experience by the impact they want to make in
            the world. And students needn’t wait until after graduation to start
            making that impact. At ALU, we break down the walls between academia and
            “the real world,” with just 10% of learning happening in the classroom
            and the rest unfolding in hands-on settings like internships and
            off-campus projects. We believe students learn best when they can see
            their education in action, and that some of the greatest lessons come
            not only from our world-class faculty and staff, but also from industry
            professionals and peers. We are humbled to help nurture a new era of
            higher education that unleashes the amazing change young people can
            create.

                        of a man who in a drunken haze recounts to the police the story of how he was found in a park,

                        expects to be thrown into the world of the Youth Attorneys, much less a world of injustice,
                        violence, rape, and even human trafficking. The Youth Attorneys are the group of lawyers and
                        prosecutors that ensure justice and fairness on campus and were established to provide a
                        solution to the ‘Adults are cruel’ complaints. What Gabriella doesn’t expect is to make new
                        friends, new lovers and several near-death experiences all in one semester. And for some strange
                        reason she is also pulled into the world of a certain gang leader who endlessly gets on her
                        nerves.

                    ALU provides higher education for a higher purpose. Our students
                    declare missions, not majors. They develop the real-world skills to
                    take on the world’s most pressing challenges. And they take
                    ownership of their learning from day one through our peer and
                    student-led approach – because ALU believes in the power and agency
                    of young people to start shaping the future right now. Together with
                    a world-class faculty and staff, our students are igniting a ripple
                    of positive impact across Africa and the world. Join us
